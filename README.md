DAoC-Auto-Login
===============

A tool for automating the login process for a Dawn of Light server which has a player cap. 

It allows a player automatically attempt to login until they are successful. The software runs slower than a player attentively trying to login. It does, however, allow you to make some food or watch a TV show while you wait in a "psuedo" queue (where position doesn't really exist and luck does!).

The software is automatically pointed towards the Genesis server (daoc-origins.net). 
It can be pointed to any other Dawn of Light server.
