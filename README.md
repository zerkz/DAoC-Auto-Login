DAoC-Auto-Login
===============

A tool for automating the login process for a Dawn of Light server which has a player cap. 

Requires .NET 3.5

It allows a player automatically attempt to login until they are successful. The software runs slower than a player attentively trying to login. It does, however, allow you to make some food or watch a TV show while you wait in a "psuedo" queue (where position doesn't really exist and luck does!).

The software is automatically pointed towards the Genesis server (daoc-origins.net). 
It can be pointed to any other Dawn of Light server.

Instructions for use:


1. Put in server's host and port (if needed. If connecting to Genesis, the default should be ok, unless they switch IPs.)
2. Put in your username and password. These are only kept in memory for the duration of the program and are stored nowhere else.
3. Browse to your DAoC's GAME.DLL path, if the software failed to find it in your registry and autofill the path.
4. Browse to your DAoC Portal's connect.exe. This is in your DAoC Portal's install directory.
5. Select your alert type. They are descriptive enough.
6. Hit start. For best results, do not continue using your computer while the software is running. After you are logged in, the software will alert you.
7. Enjoy!
